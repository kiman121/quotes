# Quotes Web Application
#### A quotes app where interested users may either add quotes or vote on posted quotes.

#### By **Patrick Mwangangi**
## Description
This application was created to serve as a platform where interested users can post quotes and possibly vote on them. A tally of votes cast is maintained and the leading quote (in terms of up-votes) is highlighted and infered to be the favourite.

Further to the above usage, this master piece was created as practice on concepts learnt in Angular (at Moringa School).

It was created using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.1.1.
